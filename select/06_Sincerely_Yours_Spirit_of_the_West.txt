Dear Lisa, I'm sorry you've lived with my folly
Suppose you're wondering where I am, so am I, wondering where I am

I saw that church grand isn't it, someone believes in it, someone was buried there
Someone was carried there hoping to healed, that's why I left, it's exactly how I feel

I remain sincerely yours
I beleive there's nothing more to say
I remain sincerely yours

I was hiding my confusion
You were part of my illusion
Now I'm not sure how to start SO here I sit alone in Charleson Park

It wouldn't be lying to say I love you
It wouldn't be lying to say I wish that I could lie with you again
My heart is more than willing, but my body finds it unfulfilling

I remain sincerely yours
I beleive there's nothing more to say
I remain sincerely yours
